                        <h2>Enrolments to Schools</h2>

           
                        <p>Enrollment is open to all school going children. On reception grade (Grade 1), learners should be 6 years of age, or turning 6 by the 30th June of enrollment year. Our high schools do not admit new learners in Grade 11 or 12. </p>

                        <p>Please remember to attach all required documents - these documents are listed on the 1st page of Application Form. Then deposit school fees at any branch of Standard Bank. The amount to pay and the bank details are listed on the application form. Please attach the Bank Deposit Slip to the application form as well. Then bring along all these documents to enrol your child. Each child will need a separate Application Form even in the case of siblings (children of same family). Enrolment process should be completed well in advance to avoid any disappointments.  <strong>Please Note</strong>:  No enrolment will be processed with incomplete documentation.  Application with incomplete documentation will be put on a waiting list. Likewise, forms that are returned late will be placed on a waiting list. No place shall be kept reserved for learners on waiting list. NCSA Schools  do not guarantee space for enrolment. Registration takes place on first come-first-serve basis.  Registration will close as soon as all places are filled.</p>

                        <p>Upon registration, learners will be allocated to classrooms individually. The newly enrolled learner will then be issued with an Acceptance Letter, signed and stamped by the principal. No learner shall be regarded as registered at any of Our schools UNLESS an Acceptance Letter has been obtained.</p>

                        <p>Learners shall report to reception on the first day of school. No learner is allowed to classrooms without permission from the classroom.</p>

                        <p>Unfortunately, our schools may allow learners to be deregistered. However, pro-rata fees will remain due and payable.</p>

                        <p><strong>Please note that School fees are paid 2 months in Advance at the beginning of the year.</strong></p>

                        <h2>Admission Policy</h2>
                        All our schools are independent co-educational Institutes based on Christian ethos and value(s) established in terms of the Section 45 of the South African Schools Act 84 of 1996 read together with Section 29 (3) of the Constitution.

                        <p>We accept both girls and boys irrespective of colour, race, nationality or ethnic group, to all rights, academic programs and activities common to Primary and secondary schools.</p>

                        We hope to provide a holistic education that will produce responsible community members and citizens.
                        <h2>Criteria for Admission</h2>
                        <ol>

                        Our schools reserve the right to withdraw successful applications any time under the following circumstances:-
                        <ol>
                            <li>Where the learner is in serious breach of the school Code of Conduct and a suspension or expulsion has been issued and the parent notified of the decision to do so.</li>
                            <li>Where the learner poses a danger to other learners, is involved in drugs, is referred for rehabilitation but resumes substance abuse after the program.</li>
                        </ol>
